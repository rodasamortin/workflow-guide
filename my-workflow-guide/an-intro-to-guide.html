<h1> My Workflow Guide </h1>
<hr/>

<blockquote><i>"Hello, Roda-in-the-future! This is my evolving scrapbook for you. Get ready for a wild ride! Wherever you are, know that I'm proud of you! Now, go back and close those PRs." </i></blockquote>


<p> This resource documents my journey in capturing my programming process, crafting an effective workflow, and the reasons behind my choices. This guide serves as a friendly reminder for my future self. A fun way to refresh my mindset when diving back into programming languages I haven't used in a while.</p>

<p> It's also a space to celebrate my wins and learn from my setbacks.</p> 


<blockquote><i>"Hello to you too, Reader! I'm excited to share this with you as well! Think of it as my pair programmer profile. Feel free to reach out if you think our workflow syncs, and want to collab for a project."</i></blockquote>
