>*"Hello, Roda-in-the-future! This is our evolving scrapbook. Get ready for a wild ride! Wherever you are, know that I'm proud of you! Now, go back and close those PRs."*

This resource documents my journey in capturing my programming process, crafting an effective workflow, and the reasons behind my choices. This guide serves as a friendly reminder for my future self. A fun way to refresh my mindset when diving back into programming languages I haven't used in a while.

<br/>

It's also a space to celebrate my wins and learn from my setbacks.
