# Git workflow

## Background

I try to fulfill a task by coding it in the simplest form. It's my reference on how the desired data was abstracted. The code transfroms to several stages:

*-basic:* the simplest and most multi-lined version.
*-modular:* convert the code in modules for reusability and maintainability
*-advanced: optional* make the code more concise
*-testing:* 
*-final:* most polished version. ready to be submitted to be reviewed or merged to main.

<br/>
Next, I will create a new <code>git branch</code> -> <code>pull-request</code> -> review <code>pull-request</code> -> <code>merge</code> changes

<br/>
Submitting a <code>pull-request</code> to myself helps me to see my code in a critique's perspective. Also, a merged PR groups related changes in chunks. It's cleaner than reading a long list of commit changes made in a day 

### Commit message

 It is the summary of every changes made. It's important that the first 3-5 words convey what the change is about. 
 <br/>

A standardized commit messages format is vital in tracking files changes and preserving the code's history
Mainly, a commit message has these components â€” *code status, message type, description.* Providing a scope is also optional.
<br/>

**A. Code Status**

I call it the code's stages of refinement.
<br/>
		<code>
			git commit -m "<b>type</b> -> <b>(optional_scope)</b> : description"
		</code>
<br/>

I categorize commit messages into several types. It's like a gist of what the commit message is

<ul><b>Message types</b>
<br/>
	<li><u> new_file :</u> initiate new file, plan, feature or challenge </li>
	<li><u> feat:</u> new feature </li>
	<li><u> bug :</u> initial bug spotted </li>
	<li><u> bug | attempt_fix:</u> debugging </li>
	<li><u> fix:</u> debugging completed</li>
	<li><u> refactor:</u> rewrite code without altering the logic, API or UI behavior </li>
	<li><u> perf: </u> improve performance (ex. basic code -> modular, global var -> function())</li>
	<li><u> doc: </u> update documentation or READMe. </li>
	<li><u> style: </u> adjust spacing, font-related matters </li>
	<li><u> chore: </u> general uncategorised tasks (ex. edit .gitignore, tidy comments)</li>
</ul>

I always start in the <em>simplest code</em> to fulfill a task. Then, I organize them to <em>blocks</em> to be modular. It makes the code reusable and limit usage of global variables.
