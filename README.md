Hello,👋 My name is Roda 🌷 ! Welcome to my workflow guide. 🗺️

My goal is to track my progress as a developer. I aim to document how my code structure evolves and the purpose behind each development. Additionally, I strive to create a standardized formatting across all my personal projects.

This project is particularly special to me because it’s the first one I will actively use! 💖

Feel free to send me a PR request for suggestions and feeback. 📬 

Thank you. 😸
