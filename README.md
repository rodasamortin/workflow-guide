Hello,👋 My name is Roda 🌷 ! Welcome to my workflow guide. 🗺️

The project title perfectly reflects my goal: to track my progress as a developer. I aim to document how my code structure evolves and the rationale behind its development. Additionally, I strive to create a standardized format for documenting my personal projects.

This project is especially exciting for me because it’s the first one I will actively use! 💖
